//! Host [`BudgetGate`] backed by OpenHuman's scheduler gate, cost tracker, and
//! TokenJuice profile.
//!
//! This is `docs/specs/plan-agents.md` Phase 4. The agent runtime is being made
//! generic over its host, so it can no longer reach into
//! [`crate::cron::scheduler_gate`] or [`crate::cost`] directly.
//! It declares [`BudgetGate`] instead, and this module is the single place
//! OpenHuman's three metering concerns meet it:
//!
//! * **admission / back-pressure** — [`scheduler_gate::wait_for_capacity`],
//!   which owns the single-slot global LLM semaphore and the
//!   AC-power / CPU / signed-out policy backoff;
//! * **cost accounting** — [`cost::record_provider_usage`], priced through
//!   [`cost::catalog::estimate_cost_usd`]. Recording only: the spend cap this
//!   gate used to enforce has been removed, so no cost figure refuses a call;
//! * **compression advice** — the agent's
//!   [`AgentTokenjuiceCompression`] profile, which decides how much lossy
//!   compaction that agent tolerates.
//!
//! # Contract mismatches, and how each is resolved
//!
//! **1. `Usage` carries no model and no cost.** The crate's
//! [`Usage`] is pure token counts, but
//! [`cost::record_provider_usage`] is keyed by model and priced from a
//! `charged_amount_usd`. Two consequences:
//!
//! * *Model attribution* — the gate remembers the model from the most recent
//!   [`BudgetGate::acquire`] and attributes [`BudgetGate::record`] to it,
//!   falling back to the session's configured model. A gate instance is
//!   per-session and the runtime calls `acquire` immediately before the call it
//!   then `record`s, so in practice the pairing holds; with two calls genuinely
//!   in flight on one gate the attribution can transpose. The alternative —
//!   dropping the record entirely — loses the spend, which is strictly worse
//!   for a budget guard.
//! * *Pricing* — with no provider-reported charge available, the cost is
//!   estimated from the catalog. See the `TODO(phase4)` on [`Self::record`]:
//!   OpenHuman will label that record `CostSource::ProviderCharged` even though
//!   it is an estimate.
//!
//! **2. `compression_hint` must be cheap and synchronous.** It once read a
//! cached budget pressure, because a live budget read goes through a mutex and
//! may touch the JSONL store. With the spend cap removed there is no budget
//! pressure to cache, so the hint is now a constant.
//!
//! **3. The hint is a union with `SummarizationPolicy`, never an override.**
//! Returning [`CompressionHint::None`] here means *OpenHuman is not asking for
//! compression for a budget reason*; it is not a veto, and the crate's own
//! window-pressure policy still runs. Since the budget reason no longer exists,
//! that is now the only answer this gate gives.
//!
//! The scheduler-gate permit is held for exactly the lifetime of the crate
//! permit. No spend guard is bypassed here because there is no longer one to
//! bypass: managed-credit exhaustion is enforced server-side by the backend,
//! which returns its own billing error.
