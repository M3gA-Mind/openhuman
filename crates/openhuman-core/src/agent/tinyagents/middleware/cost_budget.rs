/// # Shadow role (W2-budget-dedupe)
///
/// When built with [`with_shadow`](Self::with_shadow), this middleware is ALSO a
/// divergence-logging shadow over the observe-only crate
/// [`BudgetMiddleware`](tinyagents_harness::middleware::BudgetMiddleware). It
/// keeps enforcing exactly as before, but at `after_agent` it compares the
/// crate `BudgetMiddleware`'s shared [`BudgetTracker`] accumulation against the
/// authoritative runtime [`AgentRun::usage`] and logs `[budget_shadow]` parity
/// or divergence (compact numeric summary; no PII). Both accumulate the same
/// per-call `response.usage`, so token totals must match once the crate
/// middleware is on the path — this is the parity signal that must be clean
/// before accounting ownership can flip to the crate owner (see the
/// flip-criteria comment at the registration site in `tinyagents/mod.rs`).
/// Cost is intentionally NOT
/// compared: the observe-only crate middleware has no pricing table, so its cost
/// stays zero while the local path prices via `cost::catalog` — cost parity is a
/// flip-criteria follow-up.
